                                - Lamba expression is annonymous function it does not have name
                                - Functional Interface were introduced in java 8
                                - An Interface that contains exactly one abstract method is known as a functional interface
                                - Functional interface can have any number of default,
                                                                              static methods

                                - don't want to mention type in method parameter
                                
                                @FunctionalInterface - to mark the interface as a functional interface 
                                                     - show compile time error

                                     Supplier    - get()      - R
                                     
                                     
                                                
                                                
                                                
                                                  Method Reference(functional method inside only refering method)
                                                  
                                     4 method references   
                                     
                                     1. static method reference
                                     2. instance method reference
                                     3. constructor reference
                                     
                                     It reduce the writing functional interface method
                                              L.H.S == R.H.S
                   method-argument & method return type(L.H.S) == method-argument & method return type(R.H.S)
                                     
                                     
                                     
                                     
                                     method reference method should have same signature and return type of functional interface method
