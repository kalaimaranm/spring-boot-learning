                                                        Multi-tenancy-Architecture
                                                        
               
               - One Tenant Should not access tenant data
               - One tenant may face down(take) it should not affect other tenant 
               - Decrease the cost and Increase the Profit
               
               
              
                                            Storage(SSD,HD)  
                                            
                                            
                                       4 - TB is divided into 4 namespace(1,2,3,4)
                                         - Each namespace is seperated each other in driver level
                                         - They even don't know how many namespace are
                                         - Each client data stored in single namespace(if not one all client data are stored in mixed ssd)
                                         
                                         
                                         
                                         Database
                                         
                                 container database
                                        - database contains child database(plugable database)
                                        - Each child database are isolated with each other
                                        - Even we can choose the RAM, storage
                                        
                                        
                                        Network
                                        
                                       - There will only one network
                                       - It will be separeated with the virtual network by software
