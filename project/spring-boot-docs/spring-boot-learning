                                                                   Spring-Boot
                                                                   
                                                                   
  Why frame work?
                 while developing enterprise application we should concentrate more on business logic 
                 Reduce Boiler Plate code
                 It will take care of dependency
                 Basic Structure and Basic functionality
                                                               
  Why spring-frame work?
  
               Spring frame work is a frame work of frame work(Easy to implement other frame like Hibernate)
               
               
               
  Solve:
         1. IOC - give the control to the framework(creating object), Tigtly coupled to loosly coupled
         2. D.I - one class need help of other class, is a process of doing the IOC
         3. AOP - How many times a method is invoked?, logging?, invoke this method before that method get invoked,seperate the logic (non-functional code)
         4. Spring DATA - Think implementing JDBC working with that is harder
                        - Frame work provide spring data library
                                                                                                      
         Three Types of creating Bean
              1. XML based - ApplicationContext = ClassPathXmlApplicationContext();
              2. Annotaion based with XML - ApplicationContext = ClassPathXmlApplicationContext();
              3. Java class based  - ApplicationContext = AnnotationConfigApplicationContext()
                         3.2 - user creating object with @Bean 
         Bean Scopes:
            1. Singleton - same object
            2. Prototype - different object
            3. Request - use in Spring MVC
            4. Session - use in Spring MVC
            5. Global Session - use in Spring MVC
                                                                     
        Bean life-cycle(7):
            1. Declaring Bean
            2. Instentiating Bean
            3. Populate the property or constructor declared inside the bean
            4. Post initialization - DB-connection, start the Thread  (PostConstruct|implements BeanName)
            5. Available inside the Container
            6. Pre Destroy phase
            7. Destroying Bean
