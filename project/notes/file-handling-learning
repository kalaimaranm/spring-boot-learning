                                                    File-Handling in java
                                                    
     Stream -     sequence/flow of data
                  byte     character
                  
                  
   NOTE: 
        Any class ending with stream then it is for byte reading
        Any class ending with reader then it is for character reading
        Any class that implements closeable/autocloseable then the class is a resource
        It is important to close the class when it is done
        	                  
                       
                                                       Streams in java
                                                       
             In some case character stream is more efficient than byte stream
                                                       
                                                       
                              
                 1. Byte Stream
                 
                   1. Input  Stream - read() method
                   2. Output Stream - write() method
                   
                 2. Character Stream
                 
                   1. Reader       - read() method
                   2. Writer       - write() method
                   
                  BufferedReader, CharArrayReader, FilterReader, InputStreamReader, PipedReader, StringReader.....
                                                                                                        
                                                      IOException
                                            
                  FileNotFound, FileNotAble to read, File could not be read,, File could not be open, File is curupted....
                                                                                                       
                                                         
                                                      Pre-defined streams
                 
                            System.in  -   keyboard 
                            System.out -   console
                            System.err -   error console
                 
                 
                 InputStreamReader - It bridge from byte stream to character stream
                                     It is used to convert byte stream to character stream
