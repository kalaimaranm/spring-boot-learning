            before spring 3.2 the two main approaches to handling exception in spring mvc HandlerExceptionResolver or @ExceptionalHandler
            
            3.2 @ControllerAdvice for whole application
            
                  Different way of handling exception
                  
                  1. Controller based handling - writing @ExcetionalHandler inside the controller it is applicable only for that controller
                  2. Global Exception handler  - @ControllerAdvice() for entire application or any controller acquiring exception
                                               - when to send same message for two different exceptiona can handle in single handler method      
                  
                  
                  App/GlobalExceptionHandler  
                     handleNullPointerException
                     
                       @RestControllerAdvice   ==   @RestController
               @RestControllerAdvice == @ResponseBody + @ControllerAdvice(@Component)
               All the exception are handled for controller       
               
               use @Controller + @ResponseBody
               
               
               
                                                      Duplicate form submission(Double posting scenario)
                                                      
                                                      
                                    fill the form -> submit -> id generated response send to client -> again refresh the page
                                    
                                     PRG - Post Redirect Get design pattern
                                     
                                     changing the client request from post to get by sending redirect get, get request from the client
