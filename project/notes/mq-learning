                                                                 Rabbit-MQ
                                                                 
                                   
                                   
                                   
             what is Message Queue?
                  It allows applications to communicate by sending messages to each other. 
                  The message queue procides temporary message storage when the destination program is busy or not connected.
                  MQ is made up of producer and consumer
                  MQ is an asynchronus communication between applications.
                                        
             what is Rabbit MQ?
                 RabbitMQ is a message queue software (message broker/queue manager) that acts as a intermediate platform send and receive message
                 RabbitMQ originally implemented by AMQP but now it supports several API like STOMP, MQTT and HTTP
                                    
                 looks-like
                    Producer  -> Exchange   ->  Queue   ->  Consumer                  
                                   
                           AMQP- Advanced Message Queue Protocol
                           Multiple Queue with Multiple Consumer
                                                                 
                                                                 
  Producer:
        Producer is an application that sends messages. It does not send message directly to the consumer. It send the message only to the Rabbit MQ Broker
       
 Consumer:
       Consumer is an application that read messges. 
       Multiple consumer can subscribe to MQ
       
 Queue: 
       Queue is a buffer or storage in broker used to store the messages
       Once the message is produced and post in the Queue and read by the consumer It is consumed and removed from the queue
   
 Mesage:
       Message is Information that is send by the producer to the consumer through the queue
       
 Exchange:
       It is intermediate between producer and queue
       Instead of sending message directly to queue 
       Message is send to the exchange then exchange will send to one or more queue with specified set of rule
       
 Routing Key: while using multiple queue
       It is used to route the message where the message should in which queue to send
       It is like address for the message
       
 Binding :
       It is link between queue and exchange
