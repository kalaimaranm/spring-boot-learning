                                                                                                Mocking(isolated testing,to avoid dependent)
                                                                                                
                                                                                                
       - used to isolation testing
       - dummy object dummy data
       - Mocking is a process used in unit testing when the unit is being tested has external dependency
       - Instead of calling real class we just mocking that class what real class do
       - process of creating real object in mock/ imitating object
       
       
       
       
       Types of Mock framework 
       
             1. Stub based Mock frameworks  - final class and method cannot be mock, private method cannot be mock
             2. ByteCode Manipulation Based Mock frameworks    or    class Remapping Mock framework                                                                      
             
             
             
             In application we will be having below layers
             
              1. Presentation layer
              2. Web layer
              3. Business layer
              4. Presistence layer
              
   When to use mocking?(component dependent on other component or third party api)
       
              1. When dependent component are not ready then go for mocking
              2. To isolated our component            
              3. while your making third party api call 
              
              
              
       Two Types of Mock framework 
       
              1. Proxy Based Mock frameworks (proxy class will create at runtime)
                 EX : Easy and Mockito
                 
             Limitation: 
                    Does n't support for private method mocking
                    Does n't support for final class and final method mocking
                    Does n't support for static method mocking
              
              2. Byte code Manipulation Mock frameworks (use in project) 
                 EX : Power Mock and JMokito          
                 
                 
                 
           code : 
               BrandDao brandDaoProxy = EasyMock.createMock(BrandDao.class)  -  BrandDao is  interfact 
                
                
                BrandServiceImpl brandService = new BrandServiceImpl();
                brandService.setBrandDaoImpl(brandDao);   
                 
                 
                EasyMock.expect(brandDaoProxy.findById(101)).andReturn("Ashok");
                EasyMock.expect(brandDaoProxy.findById(102)).andReturn("Albin");
